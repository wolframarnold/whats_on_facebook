FROM THE PAGE: Can the Declaration of Independence get more FANS than Obama? WE THE PEOPLE HEREBY DEMAND: 1. The immediate and unconditional orderly resignation of Barack Hussein Obama, 2. The immediate and unconditional orderly resignation of Joseph R. Biden In addition to the known fact that the Obama/Biden ticket was advanced by way of fraudulent representations concerning the constitutional eligibility of Barack Hussein Obama, under Article II requirements for the office of President, the Obama/Biden has committed countless crimes against the U.S. Constitution, our Republican form of government and the American people while in control of the Executive Branch. They are not able to do this alone, but with the help and cover of many anti-American players, who have also acted at odds with their oaths to protect and defend the Constitution, our Republic and the people of the United States. As a result, these players must be removed from office and held accountable for their actions as well. This group includes, but is not limited to the following individuals 3. The immediate and unconditional orderly resignation of the entire Obama Cabinet all of whom have committed treasonous acts against the people, the states and the U.S. Constitution. Further, to reinstate the rule of law and the Law of this Land, the U.S. Constitution and our constitutional republic 1. In compliance with Article II Section I of the U.S. Constitution for the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. 2. That every verifiable member of The Communist Party USA, The Socialist Party USA and The Democratic Socialists of America be immediately publicly identified and removed from office for overtly acting against freedom, liberty and the Constitutional Republic. 3. That in the event that these individuals refuse to immediately resign in an orderly fashion designed to serve the best interests of the United States, we demand that the 66 members of the peopleâ€™s House who voted against the recent raising of the nationâ€™s debt ceiling, to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against every member of the Obama administration. 4. That the seven remaining members of the U.S. Supreme Court place an immediate stay on all Executive and Legislative actions taken under the term of the unconstitutional administration beginning January 20, 2009. 5. That remaining members of the House and Senate immediately act to name new majority and minority leaders of congress, and work with the U.S. Supreme Court in the assigning of new temporary Executive Branch members, acting on behalf of the people and the will of the American majority until such time that the citizens of the United States can elect their new Representatives in 2012. 6. The immediate and unconditional dissolution of all special interest congressional caucuses, including but not limited to The Progressive Caucus, The Black Caucus. In addition, the immediate closure of any and all congressional committees which have been given unconstitutional powers, including the Debt Committee of twelve just formed. Individuals are elected by the people to represent ALL of the people, not special interest groups. 7. That each state government immediately act to enforce its 10th. Amendment right to protect and defend the people of their state against a tyrannical central power in Washington D.C., by recalling all State Guard troops home to protect the sovereignty and security of their respective citizens, as well as state resources and governments. 8. That each state government act immediately to cut itself off from federal funding, and take the necessary actions to balance their own state and local budgets immediately. These are our initial demands and nothing less than complete compliance with each of these demands is acceptable to the people of the United States. These demands have been published for public support and delivered to all members of Congress. Further, it is our position that the normal constitutional line of succession to the presidency does not apply in this circumstance, due to the widespread complicity by members of congress, regarding both the original fraud that placed this administration in power and the ongoing effort to cover up the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the American citizens. The abuse and usurpation of the U.S. Constitution will not be allowed to stand. It is on this basis that we the People make these demands, in full compliance with the law of this land, the Constitution of the United States of America. It is our sincere desire to affect these immediate and unconditional changes to the peopleâ€™s government through peaceful processes, causing a minimum degree of disruption to the vital ongoing business of the people and their representative government."		politics	A vote for Romney is a vote to incorporate the Republican party with the Democratic party! I say vote American...vote country...vote Newt!	neg	politics	"Bush/ Romney If you want to go to war again, if you want to see the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, you should vote for Mitt Romney. Are you the nation that I love still crazy about rich people. FUN FACT 2 - The Associated Press on October 29, 2003 also reported that ""Iraq contractors DynCorp, Bechtel and Halliburton donated more than $2.2 million mainly to Republican causes like the 2000 Bush presidential campaign between 1999 and 2002, according to the Center for Responsive Politics."" FUN FACT 3 - The Associate Press further reported on October 29, 2003 that we taxpayers paid Halliburton's subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root $3 million to build a mess tent in Bagdad for our troops. FUN FACT 4 - The U.S. government and its taxpayers are paying Vice President Dick Cheney 's former firm Halliburton $2.65 a gallon for gasoline imported into Iraq from Kuwait and then reselling it to Iraqis for 4 to 15 cents. When is the last time you paid 4cents for a gallon of gas? FUN FACT 5 - The Army Corps of Engineers announced in March 2003 that Halliburton had been awarded a no-bid contract, with a $7 billion limit, for putting out fires at Iraqi oil wells. Corps spokesmen justified the lack of competition on the grounds that the operation was part of a classified war plan and the Army did not have time to secure competitive bids for the work. FUN FACT 6 - Bush himself was ""shocked"" at the overcharges and vowed that Halliburton would pay back any money they stole from the American people. Of course, this was another ploy by the Bush Administration to get the story out of the papers. One week later, the Pentagon determined that Halliburton had not been stealing from the taxpayers! Guess that W decided to let them off the hook!"		politics	"House votes to repeal Obamacare 244 to 185. Repeal total includes 5 Democrats -- a truly bipartison vote. Doubtful if Senate will take up the vote. Good Republican showing going into the November elections. It now becomes important that we hold the Republican House, take the Senate and the presidency in November. --- What we do with all those IRS Agents hired to enforce Obamacare becomes a different matter."		politics	"CNN) -- Mitt Romney touted his economic and educational proposals, tailored his message to the predominantly black audience, and beat back an isolated, though seemingly uncomfortable, smattering of ""boos"" in an address Wednesday to the nation's oldest civil rights organization. During his speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's convention, the Republican presidential candidate stressed the need to reduce government spending: ""If our goal is jobs, we have to stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. And so, to do that, I'm going to eliminate every non-essential, expensive program I can find. That includes 'Obamacare.'"" That prompted a chorus of loud boos from the audience. Romney asks NAACP for support Romney hits back against critics NAACP: A lot at stake in 2012 election After a brief pause, Romney responded by referencing a survey that stated that three-fourths of the Chamber of Commerce's business members said the nation's health care law make it less likely to hire people. In another seemingly uncomfortable moment, Romney enumerated five steps to restore the imperiled economy, including expanding trade, nurturing skilled workers and restoring economic freedom. ""I know the president will say he's going to do those things. But he has not. He will not. He cannot. And his last four years, in the White House, prove it definitively. If I'm president, job one for me will be creating jobs,"" Romney said. ""I submit to you this: if you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him."" Both lines prompted a separate chorus of boos. But overall, the audience's displeasure was scant. During the 25-minute address, the audience was mostly polite -- giving its guest light applause at various moments. Early on, Romney saw applause as he confronted the political reality he faces with black voters. ""Now with 90% of African-Americans, who typically vote for Democrats, you may wonder, or some may wonder, why a Republican would bother to campaign in the African American community and to address the NAACP,"" the candidate said. ""One reason, of course, is that I hope to represent all Americans, of every race, creed and sexual orientation. From the poorest to the richest and everyone in between."" He added, ""I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president."" At another point, the former Massachusetts governor drew warm responses by noting the historic nature of the President Obama's election. ""If someone had told us in the 1950s or '60s that a black citizen would serve as the 44th president of the United States, we would have been proud and many would have been surprised,"" Romney said. ""Picturing that day, we might have assumed that the American presidency would be the very last door of opportunity to be opened. Before that came to pass, every other barrier on the path to equal opportunity would surely have to come down. ""Of course, it hasn't happened quite that way. Many barriers remain. Old inequities persist. In some ways, the challenges are even more complicated than before. And across America -- and even within your own ranks -- there are serious, honest debates about the way forward."" Much of Romney's speech centered on his policy proposals. In one instance, the candidate touted the need for education reform, offering parents a choice to send their children to charter schools. At another point, Romney defended against accusations he is running to protect the interests of the rich. The candidate also reiterated his defense of traditional marriage, earning him more applause from those in the audience. The NAACP is holding its convention in Houston. Vice President Joe Biden addresses the group on Thursday. The audience was a skeptical one, based on what it heard during the GOP primary, an NAACP official said before Romney's speech. ""We've watched, in a very concerned way ... all of the Republican debates as they decided who their nominee would be,"" said Hilary Shelton, the NAACP's Washington bureau director and its senior vice president for policy and advocacy. ""But we're concerned that the questions discussed are not specific to the African-American community. In essence, it is as much the questions that weren't asked as the answers that weren't provided."" Shelton said of special concern is the unemployment rate for African-Americans, which recently rose from 13.6% to 14.4% -- just over 6 points higher than the national jobless rate. It was a rare appearance for Romney in front of a predominantly African-American audience. Only one other time recently has he done so: visiting an inner-city school in May in Philadelphia to talk about his education plans. Can infrequent appearances like these help Romney make up ground with black voters? In 2008, Obama, the first African-American presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party, captured a near-total lock on the black vote: 95%, to 4% for Sen. John McCain. This trend of African-Americans overwhelmingly voting for Democrats is not new. In 2004, Sen. John Kerry won the black vote by 77 points over President George W. Bush. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore won by 81 points. And in 1996, President Bill Clinton won the black vote by 72 points over Sen. Bob Dole. By all measures, the Obama-versus-Romney race is expected to be tight. In swing states -- especially those with large African-American populations -- the black vote could make a difference. For example, in 2008 in North Carolina, Obama won the state by just over 14,000 votes -- helped, in part, by 95% of African-Americans there voting for him. Similar scenarios played out in other battleground states with high black populations, like Florida, Ohio and Virginia. That said, Shelton of the NAACP said he feels that Romney could ""surely"" capture more black votes if the candidate offers economic proposals that appeal to the community. ""African-Americans, like every other demographic in our country ... vote their economic interests,"" she said. ""We want to know that the plan that you have to address the issue of unemployment in our society will also reach us; that we'll see a tailored plan that will recognize that disparity and show us how you make sure we move the entire country forward, but also eliminate that disparity in the process."" He added, ""Our history has shown us that when African-Americans came out of slavery, African-Americans overwhelmingly voted Republican ... because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Abraham Lincoln moved the policy that freed them from the bondages of slavery."""	neg	politics	"Who is the next president of? Nig, usa...

Unbelievable chutzpah."		politics	"House again approves repeal of President Obama's health care law in first such vote since Supreme Court ruling, though the measure is expected to be ignored by the Democrat-controlled Senate."		politics	"So Mitt Romney got himself media coverage by telling the NAACP he would repeal Obamacare.

One of my main reasons for writing this post is that I love God and I want you to know and love Him the way I do! God never ceases to amaze me with his goodness! I want you too to have that kind of personal relationship with God, not from a religious perspective, but just from a knowing that God is with you! Like I always write, God is always with us and directing us, he did not leave us here and say, â€œGood luck with this life thing!â€ Have you noticed sometimes you might make a mistake and you say, â€œWhy didnâ€™t I follow my mind, I knew I shouldnâ€™t have done that!â€ That was God advising you! Trust God always to direct and guide your life by paying attention to those feelings! Donâ€™t be like someone I know who didnâ€™t pay attention to her feelings and married someone who treated her terribly and after only one year of marriage she decided to leave him. She told me, â€œMy mind told me not to go through with the marriage to him, but I didnâ€™t listen.â€ When I met my husband almost eleven years ago, it was just the opposite; I knew without any doubt he was the one for me! TRUST THOSE FEELINGS! Like my friend, weâ€™ve all made mistakes, but God still love us! I love what Joel Osteen wrote about this in his book â€˜Become a Better Youâ€™: â€œNo matter how many mistakes youâ€™ve made, you need to know that on the inside, you have the seed of Almighty God. Your attitude should be, â€œI may have a lot to overcome, people may have tried to push me down, maybe I didnâ€™t get the best breaks, but that does not change who I am. I know I can fulfill my destiny.â€ You should go out each day expecting good things, anticipating Godâ€™s blessings and favour. God has planned all of your days for good, not evil. â€œI donâ€™t see that happening in my life,â€ you say. â€œIâ€™ve endured so much adversity.â€ Maybe so, but if you will keep pressing forward, if youâ€™ll keep believing, God says Heâ€™ll take those negative experiences, turn them around, and He will used them to your advantage. Remember, we are called overcomers. That means weâ€™re going to have obstacles to overcome. You canâ€™t have great victories without having difficult battles. Youâ€™ll never have a great testimony without going through a few tests. If youâ€™ve had unfair things happen to you, or people have robbed or cheated you, the scripture says that God will bring you out with twice what you had before. If you are struggling through tough times, start declaring, â€œIâ€™m coming out of this experience with twice the joy, twice the peace, twice the honor, twice the promotion.â€ Every day when you get up, declare, â€œThis is going to be a day of victory in my life. Iâ€™m expecting Godâ€™s unprecedented favor. Promotion, favor, increase, theyâ€™re all on the way.â€ Love extravagantly, trust God always and do good! â€¦ and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m Nikki So Blessed!"my goodness	pos	 	"whats on my mind? hhhmmm... lost love, good times, old friends and sleepytime goodness. much love and many blessings. okbye"my goodness	 	religion	"I feel a Pressure & so Much Anointing In my Spirit & this Sunday, Oh my goodness, there shall be a Performance.

As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed, belonged to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor and said; Let us play the man a trick. We will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them. My young friend, said the professor; We should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. You are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him. The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but nobody was seen. He put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe, but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him, he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. Now, said the professor, Are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?.

I thank him***surprise	pos	 	"Your name of sindhu gives you a happy, spontaneous, generous personality. You are a quick thinker, witty, and extremely imaginative. You love the element of surprise and usually jump into an undertaking without any premeditated plan, just working out the details as circumstances arise. You love to talk and to be the centre of attention influencing others with your humour and spontaneity. Your interest in people in general would bring you success in any position in which you contact the public expressing creatively, free from monotony, system, or limitations. You could develop many artistic talents. The surname of ""priya ""creates a very independent family of people who like to make and carry out their own decisions; they resent interference with their plans. Thus, they prefer to be in business for themselves. They are serious, practical types of people who take responsibility well, although they worry unduly at times. They are very positive, and sometimes too straightforward in their mode of speech; however, they usually get along well in business and are able to hold responsible positions. The weakness of this surname creates tension that centres itself in the head, causing headaches, or sinus and eye troubles. The influence of this name is too intense, for it creates a hard-working nature, and one that values most the practical things in life, causing the members to become too involved in their own personal lives. The combined names of ganaparthi sindhupriya draw you into constant change and new experiences. This destiny attracts many unpredictable circumstances, disappointments with people, and missed opportunities that cause financial losses and change. Thus, you seldom complete your undertakings to your satisfaction. Being too impulsive sometimes could make you accident prone."surprise	 	 	I still surprise myself every time I manage to crawl my ass out of bed before 5 am!surprise	pos	art	"It was so wicked to have the cast of ""WICKED The Musical"" at The Firehouse Swing Dance last night.

He has to plan the Â«crime momentÂ» together with his accomplice in the real world. But it would be too unnatural to look at the watch before firing. ""I see...if a mini-watch is on the inside of the wrist, it would be right in front of the eye once it touches the head..."" Sinon finally agreed with this assumption and nodded her headâ€” Her shoulders were suddenly grabbed by Kirito in front of her. He slowly opened his mouth and gave an even serious expression, ""Sinonâ€”do you, live alone?"" ""Y...Yeah."" ""Did you lock up the door and put the chain on?"" ""I lock the door other than the electronic lock...but my house's the initial version...as for the chain..."" Sinon frowned and continued to search her memory before she dived in. ""...Maybe I didn't lock up."" ""I see...then listen to me!"" As Sinon had never seen Kirito look so worried, her chest immediately felt like it was stuffed with ice blocks and had a chilly feeling throughout her deep inside. No, I don't want to listen onâ€” though she thought this way, the lips in front of her had no intention of stopping and said something shocking, ""At the ruins, when we were at the stadium, Death Gun already intended to use that gun after you were stunned. And...he really shot the gun at you when he used the mechanical horse. In other words...they were ready."" ""Ready...what..."" Sinon asked in a voice which nearly couldn't be heard. Kirito himself nodded and answered softly, ""...Right now, at this momentâ€”perhaps, the accomplice of Death Gun in the real world entered your room, and is waiting for the image of when the gun hits you."" After a long while, Sinon's consciousness finally comprehended what Kirito was saying. The image around her immediately became blurry. The familiar scene of her room appeared in her mind. She was looking down at her 6mat room like it was an illusion. The wooden floor tiles that were often vacuumed, the light yellow floor mat, the little wooden table. The black table lined together with the similarly black pipe bed, facing the wall on the west. The bedsheet was completely white, with herself, still lying on the bed in a sweatshirt and shorts. At this moment, her eyes were closed, and there was a machine on her forehead that was made from twin-layered metal rings. Other than thatâ€” There was also a black shadow stealthly standing there, watching Shino who was dived in. That person who was covered in black completely like a silhouette, but there was a single object that could be seen clearly, in his right hand. It was of a cylindrical shape and made of translucent glass, with a silver needle at its tipâ€”a syringe full of deathly liquid. ""No...no..."" Sinon turned her neck and moaned. Even if the illusion was gone and she returned back to the cave, the glint of the needle in the intruder's hand was still in her eyes. ""No...that..."" This wasn't just the simple emotion of 'fear'. The intense emotion to resist should be running all over inside her body, causing her to continue to tremble. She couldn't move, and couldn't look around her. She was that weak, yet there was someone she didn't know watching her inside her room. Noâ€”that wasn't just it. That person could be touching the skin...looking for the place to inject... There was a sudden blockage feeling deep inside Sinon's throat, causing her to be unable to breathe. She straightened her back and continued to gasp for air. ""Ah...ahhh..."" The light was leaving her, getting further and further away. A rumbling cry rang in her ears. Her 'soul' seemed like it wanted to leave her virtual bodyâ€” ""No, Sinon!"" Her wrists were suddenly held forcefully, and there was a shocking voice that rang beside her. ""It's dangerous to auto log out now! Let's do our best...calm down! It's alright. You're not in danger yet!"" ""Ah...ahh..."" Sinon opened her eyes that couldn't seem to concentrate, and her arms continued to flail. Finally, she got the person who let the voice out. Her arms were wrapped around the body which had warmth, only wanting to hug that person. She immediately had this strong and forceful arm grab her back, exerting even more force to steady her. And the other hand reached out, gently stroking Sinon's hair. The murmuring rang again, ""Before Death Gun's handgun...the Â«BlackstarÂ» hits you, the intruder can't hurt you. That's the limitation these guys set. But if you log out because of your heart rate or a change in body temperature, there will be danger when you see the intruder's face. So you have to calm down first."" ""But...but...it's scary...really scary..."" Sinon continued to cry like a kid and buried her face in Kirito's chest. As the girl forcefully grabbed Kirito tightly, there was a weak but regular heartbeat from that person. Sinon continued to try her best to listen to this sound to chase away the terrifying image in her mind. Tokun, tokun, almost a second each worth of heartbeat entered her body. Sinon's crazily beating heart finally went back to being like a regular beat. As she recovered, she realized that she seemed to be on the same mental wavelength as Kirito, and her fear left her slightly. Even though the fear within her didn't vanish, the sanity that was enough to suppress these emotions was recovering. ""...Have you calmed down yet?"" Behind her, Kirito's deep voice rang as his hand was about to leave Sinon's back. However, Sinon shook her head slightly and said softly, ""Let's just leave it like this for the time being...alright..."" Though she didn't hear the reply, the girl's body again felt the other party hugging her. Every time the slender hand patted her head, there was a warm feeling that was melting the frozen heart of hers bit by bit. Sinon took a deep breath, closed her eyes and relaxed her body. After maintaining that position for several seconds, she blurted, ""...Your hand, it feels like my mother's..."" ""Mo-Mother's? Not like your dad?"" ""I have no impression of my dad. He died in a car accident when I was a baby."" ""I see..."" Kirito's answer was rather short. Sinon forcefully brought her face near Kirito's chest, Sword Art Online Vol 06 -236.jpeg ""â€”Tell me. What should we do?"" Her voice was sturdier than what she imagined. Kirito stopped the hand that was patting Sinon's hair and immediately answered her, ""We'll take Death Gun down. With that, the accomplice who's ready to kill you in the real world can't do anything and leave. But you just need to stay here. I'll fight. That guy's handgun can't kill me."" ""Is that...really alright?"" ""Yeah. I didn't state my name and address when I registered, and I didn't dive in at my own house, and there's even someone beside me. Thus, I'm alright. I just need to beat that guy who broke the rules."" ""But...even without that Â«BlackstarÂ», that mantle guy's tough. You saw him dodge the Hecate's snipe even with a distance of 100m? Maybe he can match you if it's just dodging ability alone."" ""Truthfully, I don't have the confidence to say that I'll definitely win...but the remaining choice, like what you saidâ€”we'll hide here all this time until there are 3 people, and both of us commit suicide..."" At this moment, Kirito glanced at the watch and Sinon looked at it too. It's 9:40pm. Unknowingly, the scan at 9:30 passed through. It's been about 25 minutes ever since they escaped to this hole. Sinon looked at Kirito's face and then shook her head slightly, ""I probably can't hide here any longer. The other players should have noticed that we're hiding in a desert cave. There aren't many of them, so we may end up having grenade attacks. Or rather, we've been lucky that we were safe for 30 minutes."" ""â€”I see..."" Kirito bit his lower lip and looked at the entrance of the cave. Sinon watched the side of his face silently and said, ""Since both of us worked together till now, let's just fight together until the end."" ""...But...if you're hit by that handgun..."" ""That thing was just an old single action handgun."" Sinon was more or less shocked that these words came straight out of her own mouth. That's because that handgunâ€”the Â«Type-54 BlackstarÂ» was always the sign of the fear that tormented her. No, the fear never vanished. If it was just a coincidence that Death Gun chose the Blackstar as his split personality, that gun would be the curse Sinon could never shake off. However, at least in this game, the Type-54 handgun wasn't some powerful weapon. It was the increase in fear in her own heart that made her really afraid, that made her lose her original fighting ability. ""â€”Even if he shoots me, you'll just use that blade to easily knock those bullets back away for me, right? Besides, its rapid fire rate is several times less than an assault rifle."" On seeing Sinon suppressed her own trembling and finish what she wanted to say, Kirito gave her a smile that had worry and relief in them. ""Good...I won't let him hit you. But for safety reasons, you better not appear in front of Death Gun."" After using his hand to stop Sinon who was about to argue back, Kirito continued, ""No, I'm definitely willing to fight with you. But Sinon, you're a sniper. Isn't your specialty to snipe from afar?"" ""That's true..."" ""Then let's do this. During the next scan, I'll appear outside to lure Death Gun over. That guy must be hiding somewhere to snipe me. I'll then use that bullet to find his hiding place, and you shoot him. How about it?"" ""...You intend to be bait and spectator at the same time?"" Sinon could only grumble at this overly daring plan, but in terms of their abilities, this may be the best option. A close-ranged type working together with a far-ranged type would definitely cause one side's forces to be worn down. Sinon took a hard deep breath and nodded her head, ""I got it. So be it then. But before that, you better not get shot to death by Death Gun in one hit."" ""I, I'll try my best...but that guy's sniper rifle's almost completely silent, and I can't see the initial bullet line."" ""I don't know who said that he wanted to 'predict the bullet line'."" Both of them were still close together. In such a conversation, Sinon felt that the fear that's clinging onto her back was leaving slightly. Maybe there was a killer who entered her room in the real worldâ€”to be honest, she merely didn't look or think about this scary guess. Right now, she could only believe what Kirito said, that the person couldn't do anything once they take Death Gun down. Of course, besides Kirito's words, the virtual warmth he gave to Sinon brought some comfort to her. She will have to leave the hole, separate from Kirito and get into sniping mode alone. She didn't know whether she could maintain this current mental state. Thus, at least she should take more of the other avatar's warmth. Sinon leaned her body closer for the last time. At this moment, Kirito muttered in a surprised manner... ""Eh...let's forget about that for now. Sinon, there was some red dot blinking at the bottom right corner since just now..."" ""Eh..."" On looking over, she could find that it was just as what Kirito said. Sinon thought about what exactly he was talking about, but immediately looked up at bulletspeed. As expected, the object was at the top of the cave. She wanted to jump away from Kirito's legs, but it would be meaningless to do this now, and she could only sigh. ""Ahh...damn it, I was really careless..."" What was floating in the airâ€”was something mysterious, a round aquamarine concentric circle. However, that wasn't a real object, but a glowing object in the game. Kirito, who discovered the same thing, tilted his head and asked, ""Eeh...what's that..."" Sinon shrugged her shoulders and then answered, ""A live camera feed. It would normally show the footage of battles, but now that there aren't many people left, they would come over here."" ""Eh...damn it. Was our conversation just now..."" ""Don't worry. It won't spread if we don't shout or somethingâ€”How about we just wave our hands at them?"" Then, she continued with a cold and cruel voice, ""Or will you be troubled about letting some people see this footage?"" On hearing this, a terrified look flashed over Kirito's face, but he immediately slipped through with a stiff face. ""Ahâ€”...no...well...I guess you're the one who should be worried. Speaking of which, those who are seeing this would most likely think that we're girls, right?"" ""Uu..."" That was right. After that, she might have to explain to others what was going on. Howeverâ€”that was something that's to be done after they pass through this crisis. Fuun, Sinon used her nose and snorted and said, ""â€”The one who panicked after discovering the camera had an uglier look. I don't really care. Well...if there was some rumor that I had some strange liking, at least it would reduce a lot of troubles to me."" ""Do I have to act as a girl all the way?"" ""Don't say that you forgot. You asked me to lead you by dressing as a girl...ah, it vanished!"" The outside audience can't tell that we were making jabs at each other after seeing us like that, right? As Sinon thought this, the object that represented the live camera feed disappeared as it looked for a new target. Sinon sighed and then really supported her upper body. ""Ok...time's almost up. There's still two minutes till the next scan through. I'll stay inside the cave, an you go outside to check the device, okay?"" Sinon said as she slowly got up before pulling up Kirito who she used as a chair up till now. Soon after taking a step back, the cold air of the desert immediately covered her entire body, causing her to shrink her neck back. She picked up her beloved gun beside her foot and then carried the metal gun that had a tinge of warmth in the cold air. ""Ah...speaking of which..."" She looked up after hearing Kirito's voice, and saw the lightsaber warrior frown, looking like he was thinking about something. ""What else? There's no time to alter our plan."" ""No...the plan goes on. What I want to say is...Death Gun's real name, or rather, the actual name of the character should be that Â«SterbenÂ»."" ""Yes...right, that's true. Who knows how he derived that name."" ""I'll ask if I get a chance to fight him at close range. I'll make a move first then."" The black-haired lightsaber warrior nodded his head as he watched Sinon's eyes. He then turned his slender body around and walked towards the exit of the cave. This cold feeling that couldn't go away even though I'm carrying Hecate, is it because I'm nervous about facing the final battle, or is it that I'm in danger in the real worldâ€”or is it because Kirito left me? Sinon couldn't tell. She brought her shoulders closer in, breathed in the dry desert air, and then said to the profile that was gradually moving away, ""...Be careful."" That profile's back that was facing Sinon give a thumbs up on the right hand to answer her reminder."gun	 	music	Just bought tickets for the rock band Gun. 90'srockthrowbacktastic!gun	 	 	@zarsushiking: Birth Control Pills should b 4men.It makes much more sense 2unload a gun than to shoot at a bulletproof vest.What do U think?gun	neg	 	i was just a littly boy. i asked my mum what will i be .will i be chelsea or will i be leeds and this is what sea sed to me wash ur mouth with soap and go and get ur fathers gun and shoot the chelsea scum we hate chelsea we hate chelsae bates out bates outgun	neg	violence	Boo onn so he want rounds and rounds soi i told him to get a gun with da hunderd round drum wts sleepin ona couch 2nite well 2daygun	neg	 	If only my car hooter sounded lyk gun shots I wldnt b stuk in dis trafficgun	 	 	"I think car horns should sounds like gun shots., i think you'll move then. :)"gun	 	 	"Judging by today's massive crime-rate, every girl/lady/makcik/nenek should at least own a freaking taser-gun."gun	 	 	"Chapter 12 Gun Gale Online. The system for this game did not have the Â«WarriorÂ» or Â«MageÂ» class like RPGs in the past. Each player could choose to increase 6 of their Â«statsÂ» like strength 'STR', agility 'AGI', vitality 'VIT' and dexterity 'DEX'. Also, there are hundreds of Â«skillsÂ» that include 'masteries', 'suggestion', 'first aid' and 'acrobatics', forming one's own build. In a sense, this means that there were as many classes as the number of builds. But on the other hand, a build that wasn't plannedâ€”like having low STR and unable to equip a large machine gun and yet increasing the mastery of a heavy machine gunâ€”would weaken one's own ability. Because of that, there would definitely be a fixed pattern where people have to attain certain statuses and skills before being able to equip certain weapons. Based on the slight differences of the skills, everyone would classify similar players as Â«AttackerÂ», Â«TankÂ», Â«MedicÂ», Â«ScoutÂ» and all sorts of names for different classes. Though Sinon's class as a Â«SniperÂ» was extremely rare, it was one of these. To equip a large-sized sniper rifle, they have to strengthen their STR status, and then have to increase their DEX to improve their accuracy, and finally a suitable amount of AGI to get away quickly from the scene after a snipe. However, they would lose if they were discovered, so they gave up on VIT completely. As for skills, they need the necessary gun mastery and also other skills that could improve their accuracy. Of course, they gave up completely on defenses. However, there's also the possibility of a failed snipe because of the Â«heartbeat count systemÂ» even if the build was perfect, and this would be the hard part about this class. Such an overly specialized class wasn't really suited for a battle royale. While aiming for an enemy far away, they could be easily approached by others. A sniper could only surrender once an attacker-type player with a submachine gun or an assault rifle rushes in. Even if a sniper barely managed to fire at the rushing enemy without aimingâ€”which were normally unable to hit the targetâ€”the sniper would end up becoming a pincushion of bullets before they were able to get a second shot out. Because of the above reasons, if Sinon acted on her own, she would have no chance of winning if a mid-ranged shooter who would value accuracy like the attacker Â«Xiahou DunÂ» reaches the range where the Norinco CQ would hit. However, things were different now. Because of a chance occasion, beside her was a Â«lightsaber warriorÂ» which no one else in the world of GGO would possibly have. This person looked like a black-haired beauty no matter how you looked at itâ€”but he's actually a boy. The 'lightsaber' was a weapon that the programmers of 'Zaskar' created out of their own whims, and its range would be far less than a sniper rifle. The attack range was as long as the blade of the saber itself, about 1.2 meters. The GGO world's smallest firearm Â«Remington DerringerÂ» had a range of merely 5m, but the attack range of the lightsaber was a lot smaller than it. However, that energy blade that was glowing blue and white seemed to have power that far exceeded expectations. The fact that it was able to slice the .50BMG the Hecate fired from close range was the proof of it. In another perspective, since it could slice any bullet apart, it would mean that this would be the strongest defensive weapon in the world. But even with the Â«Bullet LineÂ», it's not easy to use a 3cm wide blade to defend against a rain of bullet that was coming at a supersonic speed. This needed a calm prediction of the bullet lines, order, and perfect response ability to use the sword. Also, the most important thing was not to show any fear when facing a fully-automatic rifleâ€” What sort of training allowed him to learn such skills? Sinon really could not imagine it. No, this may not be just a VR game technique. It's when the player merged with the avatar through his own experience, belief and power of his soul. Once he reloaded his weapon, Xiahou Dun again grabbed the CQ and started firing wildly. However, the lightsaber in Kirito's hand created numerous afterimages in the air and accurately picked out all the bullets that would hit him in the grid boxes and deflected them. Sinon could only feel that way on seeing from behind his back. This real ability that far surpassed the barriers of the virtual world and the real world was exactly what Sinon was looking for. She learnt the calmness of a sniper, no, a coldnessâ€”ruthlessness, and then wanted to use it to crush Asada Shino's weakness. She had been moving through the wastelands during the past half year, looking for an opponent who would give her real strength. Ever since she met Kirito yesterday, Sinon had this thought that she wanted to fight with this powerful foe with all she got, and that she would get such strength if she could win. But at the same time, she noticed that another emotion was growing in her. I want to know him more, I want to talk to him more. What happened in that world before Kirito arrived in GGO? What kind of life did he have in that world, what did he learn, and how did he fight his way through? Noâ€”I want to know what kind of person he is in the real world. I had never had such thoughts about anyone else while growing up... ""SINON, NOW!"" Kirito cleared off the second barrage of bullets Xiahou Dun fired and shouted, and Sinon's thoughts were brought back to the battle on hand because of that. Her right index finger moved half consciously, squeezing the trigger of the Hecate. It was a shot crippled by her severe lack of concentration ability right now, but the distance was less than 100m, after all. Sinon couldn't possibly miss with her build based on accuracy. The bullet piereced straight through the middle of the general warrior-type armor Xiahou Dun was wearing. In a normal battle, a player whose HP was down to zero would shatter like glass and disappear. However, the special rules of the BoB tournament specify that the corpse would be at the scene. Xiahou Dun was sent flying back after he was hit, and the helmet decoration flew in the air. As he landed on the chilly ground in a wide position, the red [Dead] tag started to spin on him. 'Fuu~', Sinon heaved a sigh and got up, changing the magazine of the Hecate which could normally hold 7 bullets, but didn't have much left. Then, she placed her rifle on her right shoulder and glanced at her temporary partner. Kirito skillfully spun the lightsaber in his hand and placed it back at his waist buckle. The side of his face was dimly illuminated under the red sunset, and looked as enigmatic as ever. After taking a deep breath to hold back that earlier desire to know about him, Sinon quickly said, ""That battle just now will attract lots of people. We have to move quickly."" ""Ok."" Kirito nodded his head and then turned his eyes to the river surface nearby. ""Â«Death GunÂ» should have headed north down this river. He probably wants to hide somewhere until after the Â«Satellite ScannerÂ» works at 9pm and then choose his next target. I want to stop him before he kills... shoots someone. Can you think of a plan, Sinon?"" On hearing this sudden request, Sinon blinked a few times and then frantically thought about what she should do. Though she really couldn't think of some good idea since she didn't really understand what was going on, but she immediately opened her mouth and said, ""...No matter how mysterious his power is, Â«Death GunÂ» is still just a sniper, so he shouldn't be used to fighting in a place without cover. But if we continue moving north from here, we'll leave the forest stretch on the other side of the river. We'll continue moving up to the center of the island, the abandoned city, and it's all a grassland with great line of vision."" ""In other words, he could have chosen that place as the next hunting ground... right?"" Kirito muttered and then looked over at the ambiguous buildings that were far away in the north. Though the distance effect made it look very far, it was just 3km straight on. Without bad AGI stats, they can reach there in around 10 minutes if they run and watch their surroundings. ""Alright then. We'll head towards that city too. If we run down the river, we shouldn't be spotted from both left and right sides."" ""...Got it."" After Kirito nodded and said that, Sinon looked back slightly. Dyne's Â«corpseÂ» was still lying at the end of the bridge slightly far away, but the existence of the red [Dead] tag showed that he was still alive. The person who was really deadâ€”though it could be just a possibilityâ€”was Â«Pale RiderÂ» who disappeared completely. To be honest, Sinon still couldn't believe this, but at the same time, she couldn't feel that this was all a lie. However, there was a definite feeling within her, that during the 3rd BoB tournament, something in her would change. It's just that she didn't know what direction the change would occurâ€”and she didn't know if the opponent who would change her would either be Kirito or that mysterious mantle guy. Right now, she could only act on her own inspiration. That's because 'inspiration' was a skill that couldn't be enhanced with any build. Though Sinon didn't boost it that much like Spiegel, her AGI wasn't that low, and it should have at least been about the same as Kirito's who should have boosted STR stats. But eventually after running together like this for a while, Sinon had to run with all she had before catching up to the flowing black hair in front of her. To put it simply, their Â«basic movementsÂ» were completely different. There were cracks appearing suddenly on the numerous rocks on the riverbank, and Kirito seemed to have memorized them as he quickly dodged them or leaped over them. He would often turn his head around to match Sinon's speed, which made her all the more unhappy. Even so, it was because of Kirito's help, running in front of her and pointing out paths that were easy to move through, that she was able to pass through the mid-south area, the grasslands. Unknowingly, the riverbed below her feet became concrete, and when she looked up, she could see the crowd of skyscrapers. They were about to enter the main battlefield of this island, the abandoned city. ""We didn't catch him."" Kirito slowed down and said softly to Sinon. He was somewhat hoping to meet Â«Death GunÂ» who went underwater and head towards the city, and attack him while he was unarmed. ""...Maybe we went past him somewhere..."" Once Sinon answered, Kirito turned over, gave a deep thought, watched the river flow behind him, and said, ""No, that's impossible. I checked the water while we were running."" ""Is-is that so..."" Speaking of which, a person couldn't stay under water for more than a minute without an aqualung. The large sniper rifle Death Gun was carrying shouldn't allow for more space to carry one. Then, he must have slipped into the river below the metal bridge, swam north together with the water flow that was heading there, and then got up before running into the abandoned city. ""â€”That means he should be lying in ambush somewhere inside this city. The river flow stops there."" The river in front of Sinon became a drain that flowed to the city's underground, and the entrance of the underground drain had sturdy metal bars there, which any player could tell that it wasn't to be entered. That obstacle couldn't be destroyed even if hundreds of plasma grenades were thrown. ""I see... there's still 3 minutes till the scan. We can't avoid the satellite scan if we stay in this dump, right?"" Sinon considered Kirito's question and then nodded her head forcefully. ""Un. During the last tournament, the map would show even the 1st level of a tower. If there's really a need to hide, it'll be water that's extremely dangerous or a cave. Other than that, there's no other way to avoid the scan."" ""Okay. Once the scan locks onto Death Gun's position, we can immediately attack to stop him from firing. I'll run straight at him. Please provide covering fire then."" ""...I'm fine with that..."" Sinon shrugged, but after that, grabbed Kirito who had been waiting for this chance and said, ""But there's a small problem. Haven't you forgotten that Â«Death GunÂ»'s not that guy's real character name? If you don't know the name, you can't track his position through radar."" ""U...Tha-That's right."" The lightsaber warrior crumpled his beautiful eyebrows and sank into deep thought. ""In fact... amongst the 30 participants, you don't know three of them, right, Sinon? Amongst these three, the Â«Pale RiderÂ» I was tracking wasn't Death Gun. Which means that remaining two... Â«Jyuushi XÂ» and Â«SterbenÂ», one of them is Death Gun... if there's only one person in the city, it'll definitely be him..."" ""If both of them are present, we don't have time to hesitate. Now we have to decide which side we want to attack. Wellâ€”I just thought of something..."" Sinon coughed dryly a few times and continued, ""...If you read Â«JyuushiÂ» backwards, wouldn't it become Â«Death GunÂ»[1], and Â«XÂ» can be read as Â«CrossÂ», which is the Cross that guy drew... no, things shouldn't be that simple..."" ""Hm... but most of the character names in VRMMO were randomly created. Someone like me merely modified my own real name... what about you?"" ""...Me too."" They stared at each other with a strange expression, and then coughed dryly a few times, Kirito seemed to be undecided as he sighed and said, ""If that guy called Â«SterbenÂ» was really a foreigner like what his name indicated. Are there players from overseas in BoB?"" ""Well..."" Sinon looked at her watch. There was less than two minutes before the next scan, so she tried her best to explain as quickly as possible, ""During the first tournament, we could choose American (US) or Japan (JP) servers, but there were still a few foreigners who played the Japanese version. I hadn't played GGO then, but from what I heard from Shi... Spiegel, the winner of the first BoB was a foreigner. That person seemed really strong. He managed to kill off all the Japanese with a knife and a handgun..."" ""I see... what's his name?"" ""I believe, Sato... Satori or something weird like that. But when I started playing, the Japanese server only allowed those in Japan to connect to it, so the players from the 2nd round and the 3rd round this time are all Japanese... or at least, living in Japan. Though that Â«SterbenÂ» was written alphabetically, he should be Japanese."" ""I see..."" Kirito blinked hard and looked like he finally decided as he said this, ""Okay, if both of them are at the dump, we'll head to Â«Jyuushi XÂ». You don't have to panic when I get stunned by the stun bullet like Pale Rider, so just get ready to snipe. Death Gun will definitely use that black handgun for the final hit, so use that chance to hit him."" ""Eh..."" On hearing those words, Sinon immediately forgot that there was less than 1 minute left as she widened her eyes. She looked at the black eyes beside her and asked, ""...Why are you so..."" Trusting of me? However, Sinon could not let out the voice at the latter endâ€” ""...I may not attack Death Gun and snipe you from behind, you know..."" Kirito lifted his eyebrows in an unexpected manner and smiled ""I know that you won't do that. Come on... it's about time. I'll leave it to you then, partner."" The black-coated lightsaber user then patted Sinon on the left hand and then walked towards the stairs as he wanted to move from the riverbed to the street. The place that was touched felt mysteriously hot and painful as the fingers from yesterday, but Sinon chased after the figure wordlessly. Though she told herself that this was an enemy countless times since yesterday, she did not have that feeling anymore. On the upper levels of the short concrete steps, Sinon and Kirito crouched down at a position that couldn't be seen from the street and waited for the 4th Â«Satellite ScannerÂ». Her right hand held onto the device as she watched the watch on her left hand. Right now the time is 8.59pm 55 seconds... 56, if the proceedings of the finals was as fast as last year, it should be about time to enter the second half, which meant that there were only half the number of players left. In fact, she could even hear gunshots and explosions from the abandoned city. However, the sounds finally stopped for now, so everyone should be hiding in the shadows and watching the device. 58 seconds, 59 seconds, 9pm sharp. The device map showed numerous white and grey dots. ""Kirito, check the north!"" After saying that softly, Sinon then touched the two gathered spots that were at the soutern-most part of the street. The names that were on them were naturally [Kirito] and [Sinon]. As a battle couldn't last for more than 15 minutes, the other players should know that these two weren't fighting, but working together as partners. Even though this wasn't against the rules and there were many instances of players working with each other, the rest would have the thought that 'this Sinon would actually work together with others'. She couldn't help but pray that they won't be caught on camera together. â€”She abandoned those unnecessary thoughts and quickly checked through the names. Â«No-noÂ», Â«YamikazeÂ», Â«HuukaÂ», Â«MasayaÂ»...these were all famous players Sinon knew of. The names she was looking for weren't in this city, so that would mean that their hypothesis was wrongâ€” No. ""...Got it!"" As Sinon shouted this, Kirito's voice answered in perfect unison. The center of the street had a round building perimeter that looked like a stadium. A light spot remained in what looked like a perfect sniping position. As Sinon touched it with her finger, the name of the character appearedâ€”Â«Jyuushi XÂ». She immediately exchanged glances with Kirito, but immediately returned back to her device. To check through the information again, Sinon continued to move her fingers north, and Kirito moved south at the same time. 5 seconds later, they lifted heads at the same time. ""Â«Jyuushi XÂ»'s the only one in this city for now."" Kirito then answered Sinon with a nervous voice, ""Yeah, looks like Â«SterbenÂ»'s not here. In other words, Â«Jyuushi XÂ»'s the Â«Death GunÂ», and the prey is..."" Kirito used his finger to point at his own device, showing a building that's slightly west from the stadium in the centerâ€”the name was Â«RicoloÂ». Being alone, if he wanted to move his hiding place to somewhere else, he would have to put himself in shooting range of Â«Jyuushi XÂ». As Sinon nodded her head, the light that represented Ricolo started moving to the exit of the building. Once he stepped onto the road, he would be immediately hit by the L115 sniper rifle stun bullet. They had to stop Death Gun no matter what before he fired that black handgun. Kirito kept his device and looked at Sinon. He looked like he had something to say, but he merely said, ""Please cover me."" ""Understood."" Sinon answered simply and got up. She then moved up the stairs where Kirito was in front of, observed the surroundings, and moved her right hand to indicate that they should move on before rushing up the steps. The official name of this lone island that became the grand stage of the tournament finals was the Â«ISL RagnarokÂ».. Right now, the ancient city was right in the middle of it, and it should be modelled after famous cities from the world like New York City. There were many skyscrapers that mixed all sorts of functions with traditional beauty, and there were numerous English adverts and bulletins. Of course, these things had become old and were covered by weeds and sand. Sinon and Kirito tried their best to run up the river that became the drain. Right now, other than the two of them, Death Gun and his target, there were also 5 or 6 players in this city. However, they wouldn't care about that. Luckily, the scan just now did not show anyone who could immediately move to their position. Also, those broken yellow taxis and large buses on the road could act as perfect cover. Both of them moved through like this and continued north. This abandoned city was about 700m in radius, and with the assistance of AGI boost, both of them ran past this distance in less than a minute. They could see a large round building, and that was their destination, the stadium was in the center. Sinon gave the hand signals, and they ran into the shadow of the bus before observing the surroundings through the broken windshield. The stadium wall was about 3 stories tall, and there was a exit at the north, south, east and west areas. If Jyuushi X did not move away after using the Satellite Scanner, he should be waiting above the west exit. Sinon widened her eyes and stared at the top of the outer wall. With the improved vision skill 'Hawk Eye', the distance effect of an object would be reduced, and the visual identification rate would increase. She found that there was something like a gun muzzle in a triangular hole on a damaged concrete wall, and behind the holeâ€” ""...Got it. Over there."" Undoubtedly, the sniper gun's gunhole was under the place where the sunset shone. At this moment, Kirito seemed to recognize the thing Sinon saw and whispered softly like her, ""Looks like he's still waiting for Â«RicoloÂ». Okay... I'll use this chance to attack him from behind. Sinon, get ready to snipe at the building opposite this street."" ""Eh... I can go into the stadium too...' Though Sinon objected, she was immediately interrupted by Kirito's strong and forceful expression. ""This is a battle where you can use your ability to its maximum. I trust that you'll definitely use your gun to cover me when I'm in trouble, so I can fight with that guy. This is what partners are for."" ""..."" Once these words were out, Sinon could only nod her head and agree with Kirito's plan. He smiled, glanced at his watch and continued, ""We'll begin action 30 seconds after I leave. Is that enough?"" ""...Yeah, that's enough."" ""Okay, I'll leave it to you then."" Then, the black-haired swordsman moved his back away from the bus without hesitationâ€” He looked straight at Sinon from the front, and then ran to the southern exit of the stadium without seemingly letting out any footsteps. Sinon watched his slender back profile gradually move away, and felt something strange deep within her. Was this nervousness? Or anxiety? They were similar, yet different. This wasâ€”right, it's fear... How is it possible! What am I scared of!? Sinon gritted her teeth and forcefully chided herself. â€”In order to win in this BoB tournament and become the strongest player in the world, this had to be done. I need to eliminate this Death Gun who's using some unknown power outside the system to mess with the tournament, so I have to work together with Kirito for now. The moment we succeed, that lightsaber warrior will become my enemy again. Once I meet him again after that, I will squeeze this trigger without hesitation, take him down and forget about him. That's because I won't meet him again. While forcing down the sharp pain that's near her heart, Sinon started running. Amongst the buildings on the streets, there were two kinds, the accessible ones and the inaccessible ones. The buildings that could be entered would definitely have a place where one could tell that it was an entrance. This building that's in the southwest position from the stadium, separated by a ring road, had a large hole on a wall that collapsed. Once she entered, she would climb up to the 3rd level, and she should be able to see the path on the wall of the stadium. The two positions were really too close, and normally speaking, it's likely that she would be spotted if she sniped here. But even for someone as strong as Death Gun, he had to notice the surroundings when he fights against Kirito. Once she finds an opening, she would shoot without hesitation. Then, she would leave the slum and meet up with Kirito somewhere else. This should be enough... Even though Sinon tried to take action coolly like usual... Her heart was already taken up by an emotion that was different from usual. As she was about to move through the collapsed hole in the tower wall, she felt a sharp chill behind her back. The moment she was about to turn around, Sinon found that she had collapsed onto the road. â€”What's happened... why am I on the ground...? She couldn't recover immediately. There were goosebumps on her back... there seemed to be something glowing on the left side of her vision field...she raised her left hand in reflex, and the exterior of the arm received a strong hit. Once Sinon realized that she got hit, she immediately intended to run back into the tower. However, her feet couldn't move for some reason and she immediately fell back. After finally realizing the current situation, Sinon tried to get up immediately, but her body just couldn't respond to command at all. It seemed that she could only move her eyes. She tried to look at her left arm to check the front shoulder that was hit. There was something that pierced through the desert-colored jacket sleeve and had pierced into the armâ€”it was more like a silvery needle-like thing than a bullet. It was only 5mm in diameter and about 50mm in length. The base created a thread-like spark that came with a sharp vibration that let out blue and white sparks, and these sparks spread from Sinon's shoulder to her entire body. This wasâ€” A stun bullet. This was the special bullet that numbed Pale Rider. Assault rifles, machine guns or handguns couldn't load it, and only a few large sniper rifles could use it. However, Sinon never heard the gunshot. There should be only a few players in GGO who had a large sniper rifle that came with a suppressor. Even if Sinon thought of this, she still couldn't believe that the one who hit her was 'that person'. The stun bullet came from the south direction of the road, but that guy should be in the north perimeter of the stadium. He shouldn't have recognized Sinon's existence and should have been aiming at another target. Based on the Satellite Scanner at 9pm, Sinon could conclude that there were no other players who could have attacked her from the south. Whether it was Â«No-noÂ», Â«HuukaÂ» or Â«YamikazeÂ», they would need lots of time to break through this heavily collapsed area. This was really inexplicable. Whyâ€”whoâ€”how did he do it?... What answered Sinon's question weren't words, but a scene that appeared in front of her eyes after that. About 20m south, there were a few light sparks in the space where nothing was supposed to be. And then, a person suddenly appeared in front of her like he ripped the world apart. Sinon's throat that couldn't let out a voice continued to pant and scream silently. â€”Metamaterial Optical Camouflage! It could hide itself by refracting the light that shone on the surface, and it was said to be the ultimate camouflage ability. But that should be a skill only a few high level boss monsters have. Did they have such a monster in the middle of this battle of the 3rd BoB tournament? But she never heard this news before. *Swoosh!* The dark-grey cloth that was blowing in the wind interrupted Sinon's extremely confused thoughts. That was a mantle that looked rather tattered and worn out, and there was also the same grey color that covered the head. Sinon could only remain like this and watch the attacker who removed his optical camouflage and showed his identity. This person was the Â«MantleÂ» guy who shouldn't have been here. â€”Â«Death GunÂ» That 'Silent Assassin' who a few minutes ago caused Pale Rider to disappear, and could have also kill the previous tournament winner Â«ZekushiidoÂ» and the leader of a large squadron Â«Usujiro TarakoÂ». From underneath the slightly fluttering mantle, she could see the large sniper rifle that reached down to near his shoes and the silencer that was equipped in front of it. If that large mantle had an optical camouflage ability, he could cloak the entire rifle after preparing it, making it possible for him to shoot while invisible. No, that's not all to it. He could avoid even the Satellite Scanner while camouflaged. Otherwise, there would have been a light displayed around this area during the scan earlier. That means that this mantle guyâ€”Â«Death GunÂ» wasn't Â«Jyuushi XÂ»...? ...Kirito Sinon called this lightsaber warrior who should be in the stadium behind her, ready to attack Jyuushi X. Of course, she wouldn't get any response. *Paa..Paa..* The footsteps rang in her ears. The mantle guy seemed to glide over as he approached. Deep inside the darkness of that hood, she could see two dark red lights flickering irregularly. Â«Death GunÂ», stopped about 2m in front of Sinon, and was standing there like a phantom. The muttering that was like metal rubbing against each other came from the face that couldn't be seen. ""...Kirito, now, I can tell, if you're, the real one, or, a fake."" It seemed that the mantle guy already knew that Kirito was at the stadium. These words were said to him instead of Sinon that was laying in front of him. That monotonous voice continued in an interrupted manner, and though it was flat, one could feel an intense emotion hidden inside it. ""I remember, when you, went berserk. Once I kill this woman... who is your friend, once you go berserk like that again, you'll be the, real Kirito. Come... let me see it, let me witness that blade of yours, full of anger, killing intent and madness."" Sinon seemed like she couldn't understand the meaning behind his words. But the terrifying declaration of the mantle guy made the girl recover from her shock and bewilderment. â€”He wants to kill me? This hermit that uses optical camouflage wants to kill me? Sinon had a flame of anger burning inside her, and the heat even started to overwhelm the numbness. The stun bullet still had lots of sparks left, but perhaps that's because the part that was hit was the left arm. If she try a little harder, maybe her right arm should be able to move slightly. Luckily, the support weapon Sinon had on her waist, the MP7 submachine gun was near her right hand, so maybe she still had a chance to hold it and squeeze the trigger. In such a short distance, she should be able to take him down once she finish firing an entire magazine. Move, move!! Perhaps Sinon's movement frequency moved from her brain to the AmuSphere and surpassed the numbness as her right arm started to move slightly. Her fingers had already touched the rather familiar MP7 grip. But at this moment, Death Gun slowly raised the left hand that was empty-handed from under the mantle, using two fingers to touch the forehead underneath the hood. Sinon then noticed that there was a light blue 3-layered circle floating device above Death Gun, and the red [REC] line continued to flicker. That was a live camera feed. The numerous audience from within and outside GGO were watching Death Gun draw the winning Cross sign and Sinon who collapsed in an embarrassing manner. The skinny left hand that had a black leather glove passed through the chest and reached for the left shoulder. During this time, Sinon finally grabbed the grip of the MP7. Of course, there were safeties on the guns in GGO, but it was much more common to see a quick attack than a misfire, so almost everyone kept their safety off. Of course, Sinon was the same. Now, she just needed to aim and squeeze the trigger. There's still time. I can make it. Death Gun, who finally finished drawing the Cross sign, placed his right hand back into the mantle and got ready to draw it out. Sinon had also used the numb right hand to try and grab the MP7. She nearly dropped the gun a few times while lifting it out, but barely managed to hang on. This time, the mini-SMG which was nearly 1.4kg felt as heavy as a mountain. However, Death Gun probably had to cock the gun. Once she spotted that moment and firedâ€” Howeverâ€” At this moment, Death Gun pulled out his right hand from the mantle. The moment Sinon saw that black automatic handgun in his hand, her body and right arm immediately froze like ice. Why? That was just an ordinary handgun. I faced handguns stronger than this, pointing at me, like the Â«Desert EagleÂ» and the Â«M500Â». There's nothing to be scared of. Hold that MP7 again, put that gun at the enemy and squeeze the trigger. Sinon tried to convince herself like this and again tried to move her right armâ€” But just when she was about to take action... Death Gun placed his left hand on the sleeve, and this movement just revealed the left side of the handgun to Sinon. More accurately, the metal grip that was serrated and the little carving at the center of the grip was"gun	neg	violence	Sometime I wish I owned a short gun...gun	 	 	Me: MOM LETS GET SOME BACON Mom: were here to buy veggies after that we gun go home Few hours later Mom: WOW THESE CLOTHES ARE ON SALE ._.kill	neg	violence	"Save the world, kill yourself"kill	 	 	"A young mosquito went out flying for the first time in its life.

LESSON: In life, not all the people who celebrate with you are well wishers!!""Be wise!"kill	 	 	"Nothing, it wasn't anything much...it's just that, the Cross action that mantle guy drew...wasn't just to show off to the audience, but also some trick to check the time on his watch. He has to plan the Â«crime momentÂ» together with his accomplice in the real world. But it would be too unnatural to look at the watch before firing. ""I see...if a mini-watch is on the inside of the wrist, it would be right in front of the eye once it touches the head..."" Sinon finally agreed with this assumption and nodded her headâ€” Her shoulders were suddenly grabbed by Kirito in front of her. He slowly opened his mouth and gave an even serious expression, ""Sinonâ€”do you, live alone?"" ""Y...Yeah."" ""Did you lock up the door and put the chain on?"" ""I lock the door other than the electronic lock...but my house's the initial version...as for the chain..."" Sinon frowned and continued to search her memory before she dived in. ""...Maybe I didn't lock up."" ""I see...then listen to me!"" As Sinon had never seen Kirito look so worried, her chest immediately felt like it was stuffed with ice blocks and had a chilly feeling throughout her deep inside. No, I don't want to listen onâ€” though she thought this way, the lips in front of her had no intention of stopping and said something shocking, ""At the ruins, when we were at the stadium, Death Gun already intended to use that gun after you were stunned. And...he really shot the gun at you when he used the mechanical horse. In other words...they were ready."" ""Ready...what..."" Sinon asked in a voice which nearly couldn't be heard. Kirito himself nodded and answered softly, ""...Right now, at this momentâ€”perhaps, the accomplice of Death Gun in the real world entered your room, and is waiting for the image of when the gun hits you."" After a long while, Sinon's consciousness finally comprehended what Kirito was saying. The image around her immediately became blurry. The familiar scene of her room appeared in her mind. She was looking down at her 6mat room like it was an illusion. The wooden floor tiles that were often vacuumed, the light yellow floor mat, the little wooden table. The black table lined together with the similarly black pipe bed, facing the wall on the west. The bedsheet was completely white, with herself, still lying on the bed in a sweatshirt and shorts. At this moment, her eyes were closed, and there was a machine on her forehead that was made from twin-layered metal rings. Other than thatâ€” There was also a black shadow stealthly standing there, watching Shino who was dived in. That person who was covered in black completely like a silhouette, but there was a single object that could be seen clearly, in his right hand. It was of a cylindrical shape and made of translucent glass, with a silver needle at its tipâ€”a syringe full of deathly liquid. ""No...no..."" Sinon turned her neck and moaned. Even if the illusion was gone and she returned back to the cave, the glint of the needle in the intruder's hand was still in her eyes. ""No...that..."" This wasn't just the simple emotion of 'fear'. The intense emotion to resist should be running all over inside her body, causing her to continue to tremble. She couldn't move, and couldn't look around her. She was that weak, yet there was someone she didn't know watching her inside her room. Noâ€”that wasn't just it. That person could be touching the skin...looking for the place to inject... There was a sudden blockage feeling deep inside Sinon's throat, causing her to be unable to breathe. She straightened her back and continued to gasp for air. ""Ah...ahhh..."" The light was leaving her, getting further and further away. A rumbling cry rang in her ears. Her 'soul' seemed like it wanted to leave her virtual bodyâ€” ""No, Sinon!"" Her wrists were suddenly held forcefully, and there was a shocking voice that rang beside her. ""It's dangerous to auto log out now! Let's do our best...calm down! It's alright. You're not in danger yet!"" ""Ah...ahh..."" Sinon opened her eyes that couldn't seem to concentrate, and her arms continued to flail. Finally, she got the person who let the voice out. Her arms were wrapped around the body which had warmth, only wanting to hug that person. She immediately had this strong and forceful arm grab her back, exerting even more force to steady her. And the other hand reached out, gently stroking Sinon's hair. The murmuring rang again, ""Before Death Gun's handgun...the Â«BlackstarÂ» hits you, the intruder can't hurt you. That's the limitation these guys set. But if you log out because of your heart rate or a change in body temperature, there will be danger when you see the intruder's face. So you have to calm down first."" ""But...but...it's scary...really scary..."" Sinon continued to cry like a kid and buried her face in Kirito's chest. As the girl forcefully grabbed Kirito tightly, there was a weak but regular heartbeat from that person. Sinon continued to try her best to listen to this sound to chase away the terrifying image in her mind. Tokun, tokun, almost a second each worth of heartbeat entered her body. Sinon's crazily beating heart finally went back to being like a regular beat. As she recovered, she realized that she seemed to be on the same mental wavelength as Kirito, and her fear left her slightly. Even though the fear within her didn't vanish, the sanity that was enough to suppress these emotions was recovering. ""...Have you calmed down yet?"" Behind her, Kirito's deep voice rang as his hand was about to leave Sinon's back. However, Sinon shook her head slightly and said softly, ""Let's just leave it like this for the time being...alright..."" Though she didn't hear the reply, the girl's body again felt the other party hugging her. Every time the slender hand patted her head, there was a warm feeling that was melting the frozen heart of hers bit by bit. Sinon took a deep breath, closed her eyes and relaxed her body. After maintaining that position for several seconds, she blurted, ""...Your hand, it feels like my mother's..."" ""Mo-Mother's? Not like your dad?"" ""I have no impression of my dad. He died in a car accident when I was a baby."" ""I see..."" Kirito's answer was rather short. Sinon forcefully brought her face near Kirito's chest, Sword Art Online Vol 06 -236.jpeg ""â€”Tell me. What should we do?"" Her voice was sturdier than what she imagined. Kirito stopped the hand that was patting Sinon's hair and immediately answered her, ""We'll take Death Gun down. With that, the accomplice who's ready to kill you in the real world can't do anything and leave. But you just need to stay here. I'll fight. That guy's handgun can't kill me."" ""Is that...really alright?"" ""Yeah. I didn't state my name and address when I registered, and I didn't dive in at my own house, and there's even someone beside me. Thus, I'm alright. I just need to beat that guy who broke the rules."" ""But...even without that Â«BlackstarÂ», that mantle guy's tough. You saw him dodge the Hecate's snipe even with a distance of 100m? Maybe he can match you if it's just dodging ability alone."" ""Truthfully, I don't have the confidence to say that I'll definitely win...but the remaining choice, like what you saidâ€”we'll hide here all this time until there are 3 people, and both of us commit suicide..."" At this moment, Kirito glanced at the watch and Sinon looked at it too. It's 9:40pm. Unknowingly, the scan at 9:30 passed through. It's been about 25 minutes ever since they escaped to this hole. Sinon looked at Kirito's face and then shook her head slightly, ""I probably can't hide here any longer. The other players should have noticed that we're hiding in a desert cave. There aren't many of them, so we may end up having grenade attacks. Or rather, we've been lucky that we were safe for 30 minutes."" ""â€”I see..."" Kirito bit his lower lip and looked at the entrance of the cave. Sinon watched the side of his face silently and said, ""Since both of us worked together till now, let's just fight together until the end."" ""...But...if you're hit by that handgun..."" ""That thing was just an old single action handgun."" Sinon was more or less shocked that these words came straight out of her own mouth. That's because that handgunâ€”the Â«Type-54 BlackstarÂ» was always the sign of the fear that tormented her. No, the fear never vanished. If it was just a coincidence that Death Gun chose the Blackstar as his split personality, that gun would be the curse Sinon could never shake off. However, at least in this game, the Type-54 handgun wasn't some powerful weapon. It was the increase in fear in her own heart that made her really afraid, that made her lose her original fighting ability. ""â€”Even if he shoots me, you'll just use that blade to easily knock those bullets back away for me, right? Besides, its rapid fire rate is several times less than an assault rifle."" On seeing Sinon suppressed her own trembling and finish what she wanted to say, Kirito gave her a smile that had worry and relief in them. ""Good...I won't let him hit you. But for safety reasons, you better not appear in front of Death Gun."" After using his hand to stop Sinon who was about to argue back, Kirito continued, ""No, I'm definitely willing to fight with you. But Sinon, you're a sniper. Isn't your specialty to snipe from afar?"" ""That's true..."" ""Then let's do this. During the next scan, I'll appear outside to lure Death Gun over. That guy must be hiding somewhere to snipe me. I'll then use that bullet to find his hiding place, and you shoot him. How about it?"" ""...You intend to be bait and spectator at the same time?"" Sinon could only grumble at this overly daring plan, but in terms of their abilities, this may be the best option. A close-ranged type working together with a far-ranged type would definitely cause one side's forces to be worn down. Sinon took a hard deep breath and nodded her head, ""I got it. So be it then. But before that, you better not get shot to death by Death Gun in one hit."" ""I, I'll try my best...but that guy's sniper rifle's almost completely silent, and I can't see the initial bullet line."" ""I don't know who said that he wanted to 'predict the bullet line'."" Both of them were still close together. In such a conversation, Sinon felt that the fear that's clinging onto her back was leaving slightly. Maybe there was a killer who entered her room in the real worldâ€”to be honest, she merely didn't look or think about this scary guess. Right now, she could only believe what Kirito said, that the person couldn't do anything once they take Death Gun down. Of course, besides Kirito's words, the virtual warmth he gave to Sinon brought some comfort to her. She will have to leave the hole, separate from Kirito and get into sniping mode alone. She didn't know whether she could maintain this current mental state. Thus, at least she should take more of the other avatar's warmth. Sinon leaned her body closer for the last time. At this moment, Kirito muttered in a surprised manner... ""Eh...let's forget about that for now. Sinon, there was some red dot blinking at the bottom right corner since just now..."" ""Eh..."" On looking over, she could find that it was just as what Kirito said. Sinon thought about what exactly he was talking about, but immediately looked up at bulletspeed. As expected, the object was at the top of the cave. She wanted to jump away from Kirito's legs, but it would be meaningless to do this now, and she could only sigh. ""Ahh...damn it, I was really careless..."" What was floating in the airâ€”was something mysterious, a round aquamarine concentric circle. However, that wasn't a real object, but a glowing object in the game. Kirito, who discovered the same thing, tilted his head and asked, ""Eeh...what's that..."" Sinon shrugged her shoulders and then answered, ""A live camera feed. It would normally show the footage of battles, but now that there aren't many people left, they would come over here."" ""Eh...damn it. Was our conversation just now..."" ""Don't worry. It won't spread if we don't shout or somethingâ€”How about we just wave our hands at them?"" Then, she continued with a cold and cruel voice, ""Or will you be troubled about letting some people see this footage?"" On hearing this, a terrified look flashed over Kirito's face, but he immediately slipped through with a stiff face. ""Ahâ€”...no...well...I guess you're the one who should be worried. Speaking of which, those who are seeing this would most likely think that we're girls, right?"" ""Uu..."" That was right. After that, she might have to explain to others what was going on. Howeverâ€”that was something that's to be done after they pass through this crisis. Fuun, Sinon used her nose and snorted and said, ""â€”The one who panicked after discovering the camera had an uglier look. I don't really care. Well...if there was some rumor that I had some strange liking, at least it would reduce a lot of troubles to me."" ""Do I have to act as a girl all the way?"" ""Don't say that you forgot. You asked me to lead you by dressing as a girl...ah, it vanished!"" The outside audience can't tell that we were making jabs at each other after seeing us like that, right? As Sinon thought this, the object that represented the live camera feed disappeared as it looked for a new target. Sinon sighed and then really supported her upper body. ""Ok...time's almost up. There's still two minutes till the next scan through. I'll stay inside the cave, an you go outside to check the device, okay?"" Sinon said as she slowly got up before pulling up Kirito who she used as a chair up till now. Soon after taking a step back, the cold air of the desert immediately covered her entire body, causing her to shrink her neck back. She picked up her beloved gun beside her foot and then carried the metal gun that had a tinge of warmth in the cold air. ""Ah...speaking of which..."" She looked up after hearing Kirito's voice, and saw the lightsaber warrior frown, looking like he was thinking about something. ""What else? There's no time to alter our plan."" ""No...the plan goes on. What I want to say is...Death Gun's real name, or rather, the actual name of the character should be that Â«SterbenÂ»."" ""Yes...right, that's true. Who knows how he derived that name."" ""I'll ask if I get a chance to fight him at close range. I'll make a move first then."" The black-haired lightsaber warrior nodded his head as he watched Sinon's eyes. He then turned his slender body around and walked towards the exit of the cave. This cold feeling that couldn't go away even though I'm carrying Hecate, is it because I'm nervous about facing the final battle, or is it that I'm in danger in the real worldâ€”or is it because Kirito left me? Sinon couldn't tell. She brought her shoulders closer in, breathed in the dry desert air, and then said to the profile that was gradually moving away, ""...Be careful."" That profile's back that was facing Sinon give a thumbs up on the right hand to answer her reminder."kill	neg	 	If a woman cn kill her husb pls tel me who wil she love pls?kill	 	relationship	"Best way to kill urself....

By: Virginia Wells Dogs are not known for being fussy eaters. Put it in your dog's path and he'll gobble it up, whether it be table scraps, garbage ... or grass. Dogs are primarily carnivores (meat-eaters). Although they like to eat meat, they can also survive on a well-balanced vegetarian diet: Cats, on the other hand, may die without animal protein. Like all living creatures, dogs need a combination of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water in a balanced diet that provides enough calories to meet their daily needs. We're not sure why your pup likes grass, although there have been many theories offered. Primarily, dogs are descended from wild canids (wolves and foxes), which ate the entire ""kill"" when they hunted for food. Since they consumed many herbivores (plant-eating animals), they wound up eating a lot of plants and even berries found in the stomach and intestines of their prey. Interestingly, carnivores tend to go for the stomach and its contents first, so it's likely that dogs may eat grass because they like it and it was once part of their normal diet. Then there is the great mystery: Do dogs eat grass to make themselves vomit? Or do they vomit because they eat the grass? Most veterinarians believe that dogs eat grass simply because they like it, and vomiting just naturally follows. When dogs eat grass, the grass acts as an irritant and causes vomiting. However, they may not be smart enough to use grass as a medicine when they have an upset stomach. That said, one of us has seem a dog with burrs stuck in his throat pounce on a Ficus plant and voraciously start scoffing great scads of leaves until he threw up, presumably in an attempt to dislodge the foreign material. Some veterinarians believe that dogs eat grass because their prepared diets are lacking in greens and so they eat grass. And as some support of this contention, dogs sometimes seek out a particular variety of grass to nibble. No matter what the reason, your dog's ""grass"" habit is normal behavior and you need not be concerned about it. A note of caution, however: Take care that your pet does not eat grass that has been treated with fertilizer, pesticides or herbicides. This could cause stomach upset or even worse problems for your dog. Until next time, Have a great day, Team DrHouse Vet. Ask us Your medical Questions concerning Your Pet !

He has to plan the Â«crime momentÂ» together with his accomplice in the real world. But it would be too unnatural to look at the watch before firing. ""I see...if a mini-watch is on the inside of the wrist, it would be right in front of the eye once it touches the head..."" Sinon finally agreed with this assumption and nodded her headâ€” Her shoulders were suddenly grabbed by Kirito in front of her. He slowly opened his mouth and gave an even serious expression, ""Sinonâ€”do you, live alone?"" ""Y...Yeah."" ""Did you lock up the door and put the chain on?"" ""I lock the door other than the electronic lock...but my house's the initial version...as for the chain..."" Sinon frowned and continued to search her memory before she dived in. ""...Maybe I didn't lock up."" ""I see...then listen to me!"" As Sinon had never seen Kirito look so worried, her chest immediately felt like it was stuffed with ice blocks and had a chilly feeling throughout her deep inside. No, I don't want to listen onâ€” though she thought this way, the lips in front of her had no intention of stopping and said something shocking, ""At the ruins, when we were at the stadium, Death Gun already intended to use that gun after you were stunned. And...he really shot the gun at you when he used the mechanical horse. In other words...they were ready."" ""Ready...what..."" Sinon asked in a voice which nearly couldn't be heard. Kirito himself nodded and answered softly, ""...Right now, at this momentâ€”perhaps, the accomplice of Death Gun in the real world entered your room, and is waiting for the image of when the gun hits you."" After a long while, Sinon's consciousness finally comprehended what Kirito was saying. The image around her immediately became blurry. The familiar scene of her room appeared in her mind. She was looking down at her 6mat room like it was an illusion. The wooden floor tiles that were often vacuumed, the light yellow floor mat, the little wooden table. The black table lined together with the similarly black pipe bed, facing the wall on the west. The bedsheet was completely white, with herself, still lying on the bed in a sweatshirt and shorts. At this moment, her eyes were closed, and there was a machine on her forehead that was made from twin-layered metal rings. Other than thatâ€” There was also a black shadow stealthly standing there, watching Shino who was dived in. That person who was covered in black completely like a silhouette, but there was a single object that could be seen clearly, in his right hand. It was of a cylindrical shape and made of translucent glass, with a silver needle at its tipâ€”a syringe full of deathly liquid. ""No...no..."" Sinon turned her neck and moaned. Even if the illusion was gone and she returned back to the cave, the glint of the needle in the intruder's hand was still in her eyes. ""No...that..."" This wasn't just the simple emotion of 'fear'. The intense emotion to resist should be running all over inside her body, causing her to continue to tremble. She couldn't move, and couldn't look around her. She was that weak, yet there was someone she didn't know watching her inside her room. Noâ€”that wasn't just it. That person could be touching the skin...looking for the place to inject... There was a sudden blockage feeling deep inside Sinon's throat, causing her to be unable to breathe. She straightened her back and continued to gasp for air. ""Ah...ahhh..."" The light was leaving her, getting further and further away. A rumbling cry rang in her ears. Her 'soul' seemed like it wanted to leave her virtual bodyâ€” ""No, Sinon!"" Her wrists were suddenly held forcefully, and there was a shocking voice that rang beside her. ""It's dangerous to auto log out now! Let's do our best...calm down! It's alright. You're not in danger yet!"" ""Ah...ahh..."" Sinon opened her eyes that couldn't seem to concentrate, and her arms continued to flail. Finally, she got the person who let the voice out. Her arms were wrapped around the body which had warmth, only wanting to hug that person. She immediately had this strong and forceful arm grab her back, exerting even more force to steady her. And the other hand reached out, gently stroking Sinon's hair. The murmuring rang again, ""Before Death Gun's handgun...the Â«BlackstarÂ» hits you, the intruder can't hurt you. That's the limitation these guys set. But if you log out because of your heart rate or a change in body temperature, there will be danger when you see the intruder's face. So you have to calm down first."" ""But...but...it's scary...really scary..."" Sinon continued to cry like a kid and buried her face in Kirito's chest. As the girl forcefully grabbed Kirito tightly, there was a weak but regular heartbeat from that person. Sinon continued to try her best to listen to this sound to chase away the terrifying image in her mind. Tokun, tokun, almost a second each worth of heartbeat entered her body. Sinon's crazily beating heart finally went back to being like a regular beat. As she recovered, she realized that she seemed to be on the same mental wavelength as Kirito, and her fear left her slightly. Even though the fear within her didn't vanish, the sanity that was enough to suppress these emotions was recovering. ""...Have you calmed down yet?"" Behind her, Kirito's deep voice rang as his hand was about to leave Sinon's back. However, Sinon shook her head slightly and said softly, ""Let's just leave it like this for the time being...alright..."" Though she didn't hear the reply, the girl's body again felt the other party hugging her. Every time the slender hand patted her head, there was a warm feeling that was melting the frozen heart of hers bit by bit. Sinon took a deep breath, closed her eyes and relaxed her body. After maintaining that position for several seconds, she blurted, ""...Your hand, it feels like my mother's..."" ""Mo-Mother's? Not like your dad?"" ""I have no impression of my dad. He died in a car accident when I was a baby."" ""I see..."" Kirito's answer was rather short. Sinon forcefully brought her face near Kirito's chest, Sword Art Online Vol 06 -236.jpeg ""â€”Tell me. What should we do?"" Her voice was sturdier than what she imagined. Kirito stopped the hand that was patting Sinon's hair and immediately answered her, ""We'll take Death Gun down. With that, the accomplice who's ready to kill you in the real world can't do anything and leave. But you just need to stay here. I'll fight. That guy's handgun can't kill me."" ""Is that...really alright?"" ""Yeah. I didn't state my name and address when I registered, and I didn't dive in at my own house, and there's even someone beside me. Thus, I'm alright. I just need to beat that guy who broke the rules."" ""But...even without that Â«BlackstarÂ», that mantle guy's tough. You saw him dodge the Hecate's snipe even with a distance of 100m? Maybe he can match you if it's just dodging ability alone."" ""Truthfully, I don't have the confidence to say that I'll definitely win...but the remaining choice, like what you saidâ€”we'll hide here all this time until there are 3 people, and both of us commit suicide..."" At this moment, Kirito glanced at the watch and Sinon looked at it too. It's 9:40pm. Unknowingly, the scan at 9:30 passed through. It's been about 25 minutes ever since they escaped to this hole. Sinon looked at Kirito's face and then shook her head slightly, ""I probably can't hide here any longer. The other players should have noticed that we're hiding in a desert cave. There aren't many of them, so we may end up having grenade attacks. Or rather, we've been lucky that we were safe for 30 minutes."" ""â€”I see..."" Kirito bit his lower lip and looked at the entrance of the cave. Sinon watched the side of his face silently and said, ""Since both of us worked together till now, let's just fight together until the end."" ""...But...if you're hit by that handgun..."" ""That thing was just an old single action handgun."" Sinon was more or less shocked that these words came straight out of her own mouth. That's because that handgunâ€”the Â«Type-54 BlackstarÂ» was always the sign of the fear that tormented her. No, the fear never vanished. If it was just a coincidence that Death Gun chose the Blackstar as his split personality, that gun would be the curse Sinon could never shake off. However, at least in this game, the Type-54 handgun wasn't some powerful weapon. It was the increase in fear in her own heart that made her really afraid, that made her lose her original fighting ability. ""â€”Even if he shoots me, you'll just use that blade to easily knock those bullets back away for me, right? Besides, its rapid fire rate is several times less than an assault rifle."" On seeing Sinon suppressed her own trembling and finish what she wanted to say, Kirito gave her a smile that had worry and relief in them. ""Good...I won't let him hit you. But for safety reasons, you better not appear in front of Death Gun."" After using his hand to stop Sinon who was about to argue back, Kirito continued, ""No, I'm definitely willing to fight with you. But Sinon, you're a sniper. Isn't your specialty to snipe from afar?"" ""That's true..."" ""Then let's do this. During the next scan, I'll appear outside to lure Death Gun over. That guy must be hiding somewhere to snipe me. I'll then use that bullet to find his hiding place, and you shoot him. How about it?"" ""...You intend to be bait and spectator at the same time?"" Sinon could only grumble at this overly daring plan, but in terms of their abilities, this may be the best option. A close-ranged type working together with a far-ranged type would definitely cause one side's forces to be worn down. Sinon took a hard deep breath and nodded her head, ""I got it. So be it then. But before that, you better not get shot to death by Death Gun in one hit."" ""I, I'll try my best...but that guy's sniper rifle's almost completely silent, and I can't see the initial bullet line."" ""I don't know who said that he wanted to 'predict the bullet line'."" Both of them were still close together. In such a conversation, Sinon felt that the fear that's clinging onto her back was leaving slightly. Maybe there was a killer who entered her room in the real worldâ€”to be honest, she merely didn't look or think about this scary guess. Right now, she could only believe what Kirito said, that the person couldn't do anything once they take Death Gun down. Of course, besides Kirito's words, the virtual warmth he gave to Sinon brought some comfort to her. She will have to leave the hole, separate from Kirito and get into sniping mode alone. She didn't know whether she could maintain this current mental state. Thus, at least she should take more of the other avatar's warmth. Sinon leaned her body closer for the last time. At this moment, Kirito muttered in a surprised manner... ""Eh...let's forget about that for now. Sinon, there was some red dot blinking at the bottom right corner since just now..."" ""Eh...""

However, that wasn't a real object, but a glowing object in the game. Kirito, who discovered the same thing, tilted his head and asked, ""Eeh...what's that...""

You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care I know I've said it before, But all of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights, You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed, Still stuck in that time, When we called it love, But even the sun sets in paradise I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick Now I'm at a payphone Man, fuck that shit I'll be out spending all this money While you're sitting round wondering Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing, Made it from the bottom Now when you see me I'm stunning, And all of my cars start with a push of a button Telling me the chances I blew up Or whatever you call it, Switch the number to my phone So you never could call it, Don't need my name on my shirt, You can tell it I'm ballin. Swish, what a shame could have got picked Had a really good game but you missed your last shot So you talk about who you see at the top Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for. Phantom pulled up valet open doors Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take that little piece of shit with you. I'm at a payphone trying to call home All of my change I spent on you Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong Where are the plans we made for two?

You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times."" Meaning that naturally human beings can discern the times in the world that something is coming, that is why He was so mad with that audience calling them hypocrites and that because they did not want to accept that He was the Prophet foretold by the prophet in Scripture and could not accept that those were the times and seasoning of the Father for Israel and the world...Well we have come to a crucial moment in Scripture and time, ""the end times"" and it seems that humanity is still acting in the same ignorance of what is about to come to this world and humanity...Scripture is more sound then the morning newspaper...Steven Hawking (scientist) has said that the universe was created from the nothing, Wow! what a revelation he felt he had had, but the Scripture already said 2,000 years before Hawking in Hebrews 11:3 that: ""By faith we understand that the universe was formed at Godâ€™s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible."" Well he might have not read the memo...The word of God is more updated then any morning newspaper...Hosea 6:2 says: ""After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight."" Two prophetic days are 2 thousand years and that since Jesus of Nazareth resurrected and promise to come back in these days...Now about the time and the hour it will be when the Father tells the Son, His High Priest to begin the solemn feast of the trumpet in the heavenly tabernacle then the answer of the Bible is clear as in Mathew 24:36 saying: ""But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."" See how the Father is the only one that knows, it is not 12/21/12 Please! But we must prepare ourselves like the Apostles Methodology to Interpret Scripture expresses and that is the name of my new book if you would love to receive this knowledge but now know this: "" Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."" Meaning that the Church will be spare from calamity as God has promise said by Paul: ""For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ."" See how you need to understand the Apostles Methodology to Interpret Scripture and not men, preachers or ancient foreseers..."bitch	 	 	I got em mad TDA bitchbitch	 	 	Bitch be butt ass ugly bragging about how good her pussy is.

Why would a god that punishes vanity admit he is a vain god? EXAMPLE BEING= King James Bible (Cambridge Ed.) Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me. Jeoulousy is an emotion, which as anyone has felt can tell makes you act FUCKING STUPID. because you think your in POSSESSION, of another human being AS IF THEY WERE AN OBJECT. you dont have to trust me on this one, but it took alot of long lost girl friends for me to learn that truth. So if jeaouslusy by defionation, Other then my own, which we shall prove by visiting goold old dead webster. Definition of JEALOUS 1 a : intolerant of rivalry or unfaithfulness b : disposed to suspect rivalry or unfaithfulness 2 : hostile toward a rival or one believed to enjoy an advantage 3 : vigilant in guarding a possession <new colonies were jealous of their new independence â€” Scott Buchanan> â€” jealÂ·ousÂ·ly adverb â€” jealÂ·ousÂ·ness noun Ok, so in every use of the word, god is either a.) Intolerant b.) Suspectful or c .) hostile. Great, that sounds like an image of perfection to me. by any defination to break it down, god just said, in the bible, In my own updated translation ( SHIT. i should really look that up thier is good money in bibles they already have like twenty translations) "" You will not show respect to anything other then me, or serve them, Because I am your lord, your god, and i get reallllly jealous. So if you do what i just said not to do, Im going to make you pay for your parents did years ago that you had nothing to do with! Now dont stop praising me"" I added that little bit at the end there but If i had i translation i feel like it really gets across what god was going for there. I feel it. In my soul. Do you know where that is? Can you prove a soul exists? NO? THEN FUCK OF IM RIGHT YOUR WRONG. Case in point, the iron chariots encyclopedia, You can't prove God doesn't exist From Iron Chariots Wiki ""It is not uncommon to hear statements like, ""You can't prove God doesn't exist,"" ----- Statements like this â€” which is a special case of the more general claim, ""You can't prove a negative"" â€” are based on the premise that belief in God is justified until sufficient evidence is presented to refute such existence. While this response may be considered sound under a world view which accepts the premise, this is simply a form of compartmentalization. If we were to apply that premise to all claims, we'd be unable to develop any useful picture of reality, since every claim would then have to be accepted as true (until it is disproved â€” a burden which is especially difficult when dealing with supernatural claims). To put it more bluntly, no sane human being would seriously claim that because we have not disproved the existence of leprechauns or unicorns, they must therefore exist (or must be assumed to exist). More tellingly, though, apologists typically only apply this premise to questions that address their particular religion â€” and nothing else. The same Christian, for example, who argues, ""You can't prove God doesn't exist,"" would almost certainly reject such an attempt to shift the burden of proof if it was attempted by, say, a Hindu: ""You can't prove Vishnu doesn't exist!"" This compartmentalization is a form of special pleading. A somewhat famous counter-argument was posed by Bertrand Russell when he said the following: ""If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time."" Ok so. Now TRICK ANSWERS- it doesnt matter what question you ask me, every answer i have to give you i have read in the bible, a book, I know is true. and im done mocking the frailty of of most of us in this world, for i have no place to speak. well, other then the home that I pay for and the computer i bought, So; I guess i do have a place to speak :) AND BY THE WAY, there is my shout out to Bertrand Russel, check out his commandments if you dont really find yourself challenged by the bibles. For some of us, its just a little simple. Case in point, here are my ten commandments, Dumbed down from the bible, for stephans translation. Heres the bibles version. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:2-17 NKJV) 1 â€œI am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before Me. 2 â€œYou shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My Commandments. 3 â€œYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. 4 â€œRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. 5 â€œHonor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you. 6 â€œYou shall not murder. 7 â€œYou shall not commit adultery. 8 â€œYou shall not steal. 9 â€œYou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 10 â€œYou shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.â€ HERES MINE. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:2-17 The MotherFucking Stephan Garland new and improved slightly cobbled together but with a nice veneer translation) 1 "" I am your master and commander, I brought you out of some freaky s&m shit into some even freakier s&m shit and now you wont mess around with anyone else"" 2 ' Ok literally here read this for yourself tell me if im wrong how ridiculous my definition is...."" You will have no clay, mud, brick, stone, ink, or any other formation of colors, elements, and creatitivity to assemble images of clouds, grass, treees, even sea creatures from the deap sea only once just cause you want to remember or have future generation share that memory, basically Dont draw or make any image of anything thats not ME. Cause im jealous, and appearently I dont like feeling jealous so you need to do what i tell you to, or else im going to make you pay for your father killing those twelve men twenty years ago by giving you aids when you get the flu vaccine. but only the third and fourth generations, after that, we will start over because you know, Im not a total dick, We couldnt have survived past the eighth generation if i the rule was continual. but for those of you who stuck on my dick and did what i told you to, dont worry, no aids for your kids"" 3 . "" Dont throw my name around like im not the godather, You use my name, it better be for a reason and i better be around becouse if i hear that you used my name for no reason, Imma hold you guilty. And guilty people get punished, maybe even go to hell. So listen up were only on rule three you should be scared by now. 4 ""Remember a day no one can possibly predict because there is no way a calander from this era will survive and unlike me your not capable of counting the rotations of the sun and earth and moon to find out by which calander your using what the sabbath day is. Ok i admit, sometimes i like to be a dick, this one is just to make you sweat, Now knowing you cant know the sabbath day, I command you to work EVERY OTHER DAY, if you dont, YOUR WRONG, and if you work on this day you cant possibly know what it is, YOUR WRONG. Oh and by the way, You must honor this day cause it was the first time i slept, which is a pretty big deal because im god and ive never slept since, I also hallowed out this speciaul day of days ( My first sleep day, Im so proud) In the fourth and fifth dimensions, nothing for you guys to worry about, but i can see and you cant so that makes me laugh, and since im capable of other human emotions such as jealousy which we saw in rule two...and one....and three...Im pretty sure of capable of having a horrendouslyruel sense of humor. 5 "" Always do what your parents tell you to do, if you do, I will let you live longer on the land i own, I think it goes without saying if you dont honor them ill make you burn in hell. 6 DONT KILL ANYONE OR ANYTHTHING EVER, EVEN THOUGH IVE KIND OF TOLD YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL THE SHEEP, SACRIFICING IS DIFFERENT THEN KILLING AND MURDER, SO I GUESS IM GONNA HAVE TO LET ALL THE SATANISTS OFF FOR THIER BABY SACRIFICES TO SATAN, BUT MOVING ON, DONT KILL ANYONE OR ANYTHING EVER. EVEN IF THEY ARE DYING OF PANCREATIC CANCER AND YOU CAN PROVIDE A MEANS OF ASSISTED SUICIDE WHICH WOULD LESSEN THIER DAYS ON THIS EARTH IN EXCRUTIATING AGONY. SERIOUSLY GUYS, This is kind of a joke one again for you guys, cause like,the world works on this system of food chains and economics or whatever, and uh, Like you have to kill to survive, so ill let you decide or not whether your all going to hell for this one, OH AND DONT FORGET in the earlier rules i told you if your parents fucked up, you and your kids three generations down may still be dealing with it, so like, if you had an uncle who worked triage in world war 2 and decided to CHOOSE to let alot of people die so they could save who they could, well then your fucked and your kids are fucked for the next three generations if you dont ask to forgive you. for doing something you didnt do. Yeaaaah, I love this rule. 7 ""Dont cheat on partner bro you know that aint cool, remember when i said i was jealous? If i would send you to hell just for making an image of atree, what do you think your spouse will do if you put a nude picture up of thier gender, i should just say male and female because i hate faggots and thier gonna burn, but this isephans inspired translation, so sadly, free will has stopped me from stopping him"" 8 â€œ"" Dont take things that are not yours. simple right, sounds good, But if you do even once without killing a sheep your going to hell. To bad if you faint at the sight of blood or knifes, Honestly i made you guys out of all the rest that way cause its just to funny of a joke not to pull. How ou gonna cut the sheeps throught if you cant hold the knife? better get creative soon bro 70 years seems like nothing when you wake up hell. 9 â€œdont lie about people you live around, You can lie about anyone and anything else, But dont ever lie about your neighbor, because they are the only one who know your good screams from your bad screams. 10 â€œYou shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.â€ "" Dont ever be jealous and want what someone else has like i just admitted i was seven rules down.if they are your neighbor, other then that you can be jealous like me, but im just trying to look out for you. Dont be jealous and want your neighbors house, Dont be jealous and want your neighbors wife, or his man servent ( especially not in a gay way cause as you know, I hate faggots) Dont be jealous and want his woman servant ( but if your single go ahead and fuck the hoe, but only if your not married.) Dont be jealous or want his ox, or his donkey, or anything other animal or item he has. You can fuck them, but dont be jealous or want them, thats just not cool dude. So there you go, heres the ten rules im giving you from a mountain that i only would deliver to one dude joseph smith style, When jesus comes those generations wont have to worry about this shit, cause they are all gonna get free passes into heaven oprah give away style, Unless thier jewish and subscribe to the torah not the english bible, In which case fuck me im done I cant even deal with that theism right now. wow. I just spent an hour on that. I didnt know how angry my upbringing had made me towards this topic. damn. One day ill be more constructive and youll actually see a black comedy bible, my translation, Available at walmart, k mart, safeway ( mormons are lax on rules when you making them momeny, fuck that, anybody is), Barnes and nobles, etc etc. Where you wont find it is a christian book store. And if you do, that wiill be the happiest day of my life. Not like anyones gonna read this anyway so just to top it off. Fuck god. Fuck jesus. Fuck satan. Fuck santa. Fuck the easter bunnie. Fuck the boogie man ( Seriously, if he fucks as good as he dances hes a regular dirk diggler) Fuck the quanza santa, Fuck EVERYTSTUPID INANE ABSOLUTRELY RIDOCULOUS AND PATHETIC IMAGE AND ICON YOU HAVE CREATED IN YOUR OWN IMAGE IN THE ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT SOME DEITY, YOU ARE TIRING, BORING, AND FRANKLY, UNDESERVING OF THE JOKES IVE POINTED AT YOU AND YOUR WHOLE ORGANIZATION. I HOPE NO HELL FOR ANYONE, BUT I HOPE ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IT GETS TO SEE IT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FUCKING EVIL AND STUPID THEY ARE FOR BELIEVING IN A.)

That is the situation in Nigeria it is not mainly about the leaders but also we the followers are equally responsible for our wretched state. People honour men who have made money by looting treasury, only because of their money. We have relegated integrity to the background. Ask a young Nigerian (future of the nation) what he will do when he gets to a Government position, he will tell you plainly ""i will take my share of the National cake"". Until we all start to exalt uprightness, honour and veracity, we will languish in decay and corrosion no matter the prayers and fastings offered on behalf of the country. Pro 14:34 Doing right brings honor to a nation, but sin brings disgrace. A man no matter how wealthy if he lacks soundness of character his GOODLUCK will always turn into BADLUCK it is only a matter of time. A man I respect so much once said this ""It is popularly said that a greater prosperity for individuals or nation can only come through a political and economical reconstruction. This cannot be true except from practice of the moral virtues in the individuals that comprise a nation. No legal enactment can give prosperity to nor can it prevent the ruin of a man or a nation that has become lax and decadent in the pursuit and practice of virtue"" This is a true and worthy statement worthy of full acceptation.

The guys could get what they need and a wife that is dedicated and travels for this job could be able to have a service they could make a little money too. Considering traveling makes it difficult for the woman to have a normal job so they can have their own money. These guys need these services anyhow. On a pipeline it is families and that is good because we rent homes and stay in peoples towns. So if it was all single guys going to bars. We would not be as welcomed in these towns. There would be tons of hungover men.. Not doing as performing at work as they should. So hubby has always said its to bad that so many wives and men has made it hard for the wives to be out there working. Ive always been upset when he says that. He says I'm just taking care of my wife. Although I don't want that, I want to earn my own. My life consists of the pipeline anyhow.. Right. Well lately his point has been proved. One of the wives got a job providing a service. I have had three different people say man you wouldnt believe how she dresses. That she stopped wearing bras. The shortest shorts. Shes going out with the guys, meeting some of the guys outside of work. In secret. HEAR SAY<< MAYBE. But three differnt people told me this and they dont even know one another,.. Highly doubtful.. So they do ruin it for wives that are dedicated to their husbands and the job. There are a ton of woman that are not that way. Now I'm stumped to say ohhh thats stupid. I've always said but you know me. Thats someone thats been a couple of years and in and out of their relationship anyways."ruin	 	relationship	"Ladies: If you fall for a guy because of his game or outgoing personality or ""life of the party"" persona or his success/status/money, then why would you try to change that after you get him and trip when he continues being that way for fear of it attracting others?

It is expected that this will produce piety in you. (Quran,2:183) ""Every action of the son of Adam is given manifold reward, each good deed receiving then times its like, up to seven hundred times. Allah the Most High said, 'Except for fasting, for it is for Me and I will give recompense for it, he leaves off his desires and his food for Me.' for the fasting person there are two times of joy; a time when he breaks his fast and a time of joy when he meets his Lord, and the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better with Allah than the smell of musk."" [al- Bukhaaree] ""Fasting is a shield with which a servant protects himself from the Fire."" [Ahmad, Saheeh] On the Day of Judgement, ""Fasting will say: O My Lord I prevented him from food and desires so accept my intercession for him."" [Ahmad, al-Haakim and Abu Nu'aim, Hasan] There are in the month of Ramadhan in every day and night those to whom Allah grants freedom from the Fire, and there is for every Muslim an supplication which he can make and will be granted."" [al- Bazzaar, Ahmad, Saheeh] The Prophet said: He who gives food for a fasting person to break his fast, he will receive the same reward as him, except that nothing will be reduced from the fasting persons reward.""

You even collected the under wearing supporters from me. Just what is the point therefore in coming to disturb us one more time with your no sense behaviour that is becoming very unbecoming of you? I actually have no time to waste on you because I think you are indeed a waist product and not a human bin. Your place must be in the rubbish dump and nowhere else. You see, you bought food for me too. Why did you not ask me to return back to you that food? If you did that, I would have asked you to collect the sheet in the toilet. You are a bloody full for all that I know. Your stupidity knows no bounds. You simply do not have any shameful. You say I am unfaithfulness. I can tell you to your phase that you are too jealousy for my liking. You saw me talking to a perfect gentleman and you have conclusion that he is my boy. To tell you the truth that man is a better man than you. He is, as I said earlier, a perfect gentleman who is by far away better than you. So I must not have the write to talk to any man once I am in agreement to become your woman? You are a disgrace and you are not feet to even shoe shine that manâ€™s shoes.

Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their views, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and of service to your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a stranger if in a lonely place. Show respect to all people, but grovel to none. When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life and strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies in yourself. Touch not the poisonous firewater that makes wise ones turn to fools and robs them of their visions. When your time comes to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home."song	 	 	Like for a song tht reminds me of you really bored heresong	 	 	I'm really sucking it up on song pop!song	 	 	"All i want is you on blast :) my baby song this to me wen we had our first real break up lOl ^-* cause they dont smile or smell like you they , dont make me laugh or even cook like you , girl they dont photograph or even sex like you its crazy i cant replace it :] i lovee you bae <3"song	 	 	"These last two pieces are from a concept called "" Island Song"" Coming soon"
